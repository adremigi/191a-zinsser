# Zinsser, _On Writing Well_, Chapters 2-3

Summary by Alexander Remigio

Some writers often have “writer’s block” when it comes to essays, papers, etc.  Zinsser focuses on the problem of writing and what causes it to be so difficult.  This includes people having an unclear mind process, cluttered thoughts, and some find themselves at a loss for words.  A “ripple” effect also takes effect when writer’s block takes place.  When confronted with a problem with the paper during the writing process, he/she then loses interest in the subject at hand, branching off to different scenarios that lead to procrastination.  However, Zinsser also focuses on simplicity.  Simplicity helps a writer with his paper, and although the word itself is contradicting to a complex essay, it is efficient in focusing on the topic that the paper/essay addresses.  Simplicity also helps with eliminating the clutter.
